The Importance of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) has so much to offer. As of our current situation. OOP has been around the places especially for the fast-food restaurant and that is one example of a real-world scenario wherein we benefit 
from that particular system to enhance or to have a quick response and to be able to prevent the long lines in fast food restaurants. 

Encapsulation. One of the key principles in OOP handles the internal state of an object from its external environment and only provides a public interface that other program components can use to communicate with it. Example: Banking System.
Inheritance. is a mechanism by which a new class (called a subclass or derived class) is created from an existing class (called a superclass or base class). Example: Shapes Hierarchy
Polymorphism. It allows executing an action in multiple ways by treating objects of different classes as belonging to a common superclass. Example: Animal Kingdom.
Abstraction. is the method of demystifying complicated reality by creating problem-specific models. Example: File Handling.

In essence, these principles work together to facilitate the design, implementation, and maintenance of object-oriented software systems, promoting code reusability, extensibility, and maintainability.
